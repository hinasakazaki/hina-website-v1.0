        <br> <br> 
	    	End of Summer! <br> <br> 
	     Today's my last day as a <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://www.Zynga.com" target="_blank"> Zynga </a> </div> Software Engineer Intern. What a journey. Getting to make a game out of scratch and win 2nd place in the Intern Innovation project, working on a large codebase and figuring out how mobile games work (How it logs into facebook, how it updates its notificaiton badges on the home screen..)... What a journey. I have learned so much. I can't thank the full time software engineers who helped me through this. I also made great friends. I hope I'll see them in the future. <br> <br> 

        Yeah, Summer had been kind of awesome. I need to make a TI4 album/page to showcase all the stuff I did at The  <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/" target="_blank">International Dota2 Tournament</a> </div>. I supported Vici from the beginning and it actually won 2nd place! Wow. Something about second places this summer... Oh, in terms of Dota2, I'm transitioning to a semi-carry. I am super good at Necrophos. What!? <br> <br>

        But great things await me now. AKA:  <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://ludumdare.com" target="_blank"> LUDUM DARE!!!!</a> </div> Too much hype. Making Forge with my intern teammates really sparked a fire within me... To create more games. This weekend will be tough. I'll be on a five hour carride with my parents to visit my sister at Caltech. It's not ideal for Ludum Dare. But I'll do it!!! To look at my progress, follow me on <div class ="link"> <a href = "https://twitter.com/swaggerzaki" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </div>. <br><br>

		   	Next Thursday, school will start. As a Computer Science and Economics double major, I'm very lucky to be involved in the UC Berkeley Computer Science community! I'm the L&S CS Peer Advisor and served two terms as <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://www.csua.berkeley.edu" target="_blank"> CSUA </a> </div> President! I've signed up to be an officer. I also will be leading another semester of The Video Games and You: Player's Perspective decal with <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://calvinkirbikaka.com/" target="_blank">Kirbikaka </a> </div>  :)  <br> <br>
<!-- 
	        It's my last year here, and I've learned so much, including running <div class ="link"> <a href = "projects.html"> regressions on Stata </a> </div>, making <div class ="link"> <a href = "projects.html"> apps </a> </div>, <div class ="link"> <a href = "projects.html"> cooking </a> </div>, playing <div class ="link"> <a href = "http://dotabuff.com/players/86129013" target="_blank">  DotA2 </a> </div>, organizing <div class ="link"> <a href = "events.html"> awesome events </a> </div>, <div class ="link"> <a href = "videogamedecal.html">teaching people about Games </a> </div>, and so much more!
	        I was also a trombonist in the UCBSO, the University Orchestra for 5 semesters, and participated in UC Jazz for a semester.

	        While you're reading (which I'm impressed, since most people skip over multiparagraph texts), go ahead and check out my <div class ="link"> <a href = "misc/sp2014resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume </a> </div> and the rest of my website. Hover over the tiles on the left for some surprises! <br> <br>

	        Enjoy! <br> <br>
